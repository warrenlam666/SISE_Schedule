Description: Python Module Security Admonition
        =================================
        
        If you are reading this admonition while running pip, I'd like to take
        this time to inform you that you just ran arbitrary code from the untrusted
        internet (maybe even as root?). The fact that this was so easy is a bit of a
        problem.
        
        Remember when RubyGems.org got compromised and was down since they weren't
        sure whether there were any problems with the gems themselves? That could
        have just as easily been PyPI. Adding SSL to PyPI and certificate checking
        to pip were big steps forward, but we need to make shipping and installing
        modules securely even easier. I'm not sure whether that means developer
        certificates or package signing or something else, but we need to find a
        way to run only trusted code. As long as a one character typo can root your
        box, the problem persists.
